[ Note: If you're building a Neurocommons mirror, then you probably want to
  read NEUROCOMMONS_INSTALL.txt, rather than starting here. ]

This module depends on the Perl modules "DBD::ODBC" and "DBI", which you will
need to install first.

Note that the DBD::ODBC Perl module requires one of two C libraries in
order to function: you will need to install either the "unixODBC" package,
or the "iODBC" package.  (Most people seem to use unixODBC.)

To install this module, run the following commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

Once installed, you will need to create a /etc/rdfherd-config.pl file.
Sample config files can be found in the "config" directory.

What you do next depends on what you want to do.  If you're building a
Neurocommons mirror, then the rest of the installation process is described
in the file "NEUROCOMMONS_INSTALL.txt".

If you're updating from a previous version of RDFHerd, be sure to read any
applicable release notes at the top of the file "Changes".
