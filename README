Tools for managing herds of RDF.

Initially this just addresses the problem of managing a collection of data
feeds keeping an RDF database up to date.  Also initially, the only
supported database server is Virtuoso.

If you're building a Neurocommons mirror, then you probably want to read
the file "NEUROCOMMONS_INSTALL.txt" for installation instructions.

If you're updating from a previous version of RDFHerd, be sure to read any
applicable release notes at the top of the file "Changes".
